# Get That

**Get That** is a open-source software being made with wxWidgets and C++ to assist developers and translators with their development and translation workflow. It is being designed to work primarily with *.arb* files and the Flutter framework, as is the kind of project I am working right now. In future updates, I may add support for another type of files.
